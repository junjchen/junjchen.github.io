#### Agile methodology Manifesto

1. *Individuals and interactions* over process and tools
2. *Woking software* over comprehensive documentation
3. *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation
4. *Responding to change* over following a plan

#### Principles

1. Continuous delivery of valuable software
2. Open to changes, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently
4. Business people ( customer representative ) and developer working together
5. Motivated Individuals
6. Encourage face to face communication
7. Working software as measure of progress
8. Sustainable development, stake holders of the project maintains a constant pace
9. Attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity, do not over engineer
11. Self-organizing team
12. Team adjust their behavior reflectively at regular intervals

#### Implementation of Agile

Scrum, XP, ...

#### eXtreme Programming

Goal is reduce the cost of changes in requirement by having multiple short development cycles

1. Coding ( pair programming, code review )
2. Testing ( unit test, acceptance test )
3. Listening ( communication, planning game )
4. Designing ( simplicity, reduce dependencies )

Criticisms
- Informal changes from onsite customer
- Scalability

#### Scrum

Key feature: Sprint, a short iteration of product development

Practices
- Planning meeting
- Daily scrum
- Retrospective

Tools
- Product backlog
- Spring backlog
- Burn down chart

Features
- Small team, small increments of development
- Rapid development
- Emphasis of testing
- Close customer communication
- Flexible requirements

Criticisms
- Scalability
- Requirement drift
- Lack of high level oversight

> Principles behind Agile Manifesto focus on delivery of working software incrementally, self-organizing team adjust its behavior reflectively, fact to face communications, listen to voice from customers while change requirements accordingly event it is late in the development, and simple design. ( WORKING_SOFTWARE, TEAM, COMMUNICATION, CUSTOMER, CHANGE, DESIGN )

> Extreme Programming aim at minimize the cost of changes: Designing: Simplicity, Coding: Pair programming, Testing: Extensive, Listening: Communication

> Scrum: Sprint, backlog, and other practices
