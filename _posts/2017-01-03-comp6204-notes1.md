### What information system failure mean

An information system failure is one that either

1. not perform as expected
2. not operational on time
3. can not be used in the way it was intended

As many as 75% of large systems are considered to be operating failures because *they didn't bring about the intended benefits*. A proportion of these failures occur when the systems are *not used as intended* or *not used at all*.

### Why failures happen

Organizational reasons rather than technical

1. Not understand system development implies organizational change
2. Insufficient user involvement leads to unmet user needs
3. Poor match between development methodology and organizational culture

### Poor management factors

1. Insufficient motivation
2. Incorrect estimation
3. Inadequate control of time
4. Inadequate control of cost
5. Lack of understanding and time to learn
6. Other human factors

### What's different about software

1. New
2. Different
3. Virtual rather than physical, so constraints to the real world don't apply
4. There is no manufacturing side of it
5. Complexity
