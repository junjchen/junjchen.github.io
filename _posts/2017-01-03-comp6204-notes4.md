### Quality in software

#### Definition

Difficult to define. High quality software can be described as

- Compiles with specification
- Does "clever things" quickly and easily
- Doesn't fail

However those definitions are vague and imprecise

#### Good enough quality

Perfection is too expensive to achieve, so compromise is made to trade quality for cost and time

Notion of trading quality for cost and time is a widespread, recognized and good practice in most industries

#### Quality assurance and Quality control

Quality assurance: *Planned and systematic* activities implemented in a quality system so that quality requirements for a product or service will be fulfilled

Quality control: Observation techniques and activities used to fulfill requirements for quality

#### Practices

1. Introduction of inspector takes up responsibility for quality
2. Development of quality control ideas and techniques
3. Consideration of cost of scrap and reworking
4. Systematic approach to control quality

> In order to build good quality software, the definition of software quality should be established in the first place, which has not so far. It is common to trade quality for cost and time, and it is generally considered a good practice to do so. Since perfection is unachievable, it is more realistic to build a software with acceptable quality from some measurable metrics

> Quality assurance is planned and systematic activities conducted to ensure the quality of a product. Quality control is observation techniques and activities to fulfill requirements for quality.
