### Software development models

#### Waterfall

Linear nature, assumes stability and certainty about requirement and environment

```
Requirement
-> Design
-> Implementation
-> Verification
-> Maintenance
```

#### V model

Variation of waterfall

```
Requirements analysis <-> Operational testing
    High level design <-> Integration testing
        Detailed spec <-> Unit testing
            Implementation
```

#### Build and fix

Idea of cycles in development, notion of retirement

```
Build 1st version
-> Modify until client satisfied
-> Maintenance phase
-> Retirement
```

#### Spiral model

Nonlinear development, spiral iterating through waterfall stages

#### Others

1. Incremental
2. Prototyping / Rapid prototyping
3. Formal methods
4. Agile process
5. RUP ( Rational Unified Process )

> Software development methodologies is a splitting of software development work into distinct phases containing activities with the intent of better planning and management

> There is no perfect methodology, all with their pros and cons, real developments rarely follow any of them exactly
