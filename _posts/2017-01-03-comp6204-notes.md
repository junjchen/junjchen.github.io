## What information system failure mean

An information system failure is one that either

1. not perform as expected
2. not operational on time
3. can not be used in the way it was intended

As many as 75% of large systems are considered to be operating failures because *they didn't bring about the intended benefits*. A proportion of these failures occur when the systems are *not used as intended* or *not used at all*.

### Why failures happen

Organizational reasons rather than technical

1. Not understand system development implies organizational change
2. Insufficient user involvement leads to unmet user needs
3. Poor match between development methodology and organizational culture

### Poor management factors

1. Insufficient motivation
2. Incorrect estimation
3. Inadequate control of time
4. Inadequate control of cost
5. Lack of understanding and time to learn
6. Other human factors

### What's different about software

1. New
2. Different
3. Virtual rather than physical, so constraints to the real world don't apply
4. There is no manufacturing side of it
5. Complexity

> Software system is considered failed in many ways, either it is not operating as designed, not operating on time, or not deliver intended values.

> Failure can happen due to technical as well as organizational reasons. Commonly due to mis alignment of development steps and organizational changes / culture, and insufficient user involvement.

> Some of the poor management factors includes incorrect estimation, poor control on time and cost, and lack of motivation.

> Software is different from traditional product because it is new, different, virtual, complex, and does not need manufacturing.  

## Software development models

### Waterfall

Linear nature, assumes stability and certainty about requirement and environment

```
Requirement
-> Design
-> Implementation
-> Verification
-> Maintenance
```

### V model

Variation of waterfall

```
Requirements analysis <-> Operational testing
    High level design <-> Integration testing
        Detailed spec <-> Unit testing
            Implementation
```

### Build and fix

Idea of cycles in development, notion of retirement

```
Build 1st version
-> Modify until client satisfied
-> Maintenance phase
-> Retirement
```

### Spiral model

Nonlinear development, spiral iterating through waterfall stages

### Others

1. Incremental
2. Prototyping / Rapid prototyping
3. Formal methods
4. Agile process
5. RUP ( Rational Unified Process )

> Software development methodologies is a splitting of software development work into distinct phases containing activities with the intent of better planning and management

> There is no perfect methodology, all with their pros and cons, real developments rarely follow any of them exactly

## Agile methodology

### Manifesto

1. *Individuals and interactions* over process and tools
2. *Woking software* over comprehensive documentation
3. *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation
4. *Responding to change* over following a plan

### Principles

1. Continuous delivery of valuable software
2. Open to changes, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently
4. Business people ( customer representative ) and developer working together
5. Motivated Individuals
6. Encourage face to face communication
7. Working software as measure of progress
8. Sustainable development, stake holders of the project maintains a constant pace
9. Attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity, do not over engineer
11. Self-organizing team
12. Team adjust their behavior reflectively at regular intervals

### Implementation of Agile

Scrum, XP, ...

### eXtreme Programming

Goal is reduce the cost of changes in requirement by having multiple short development cycles

1. Coding ( pair programming, code review )
2. Testing ( unit test, acceptance test )
3. Listening ( communication, planning game )
4. Designing ( simplicity, reduce dependencies )

Criticisms

- Informal changes from onsite customer
- Scalability

### Scrum

Key feature: Sprint, a short iteration of product development

Practices

- Planning meeting
- Daily scrum
- Retrospective

Tools

- Product backlog
- Spring backlog
- Burn down chart

Features

- Small team, small increments of development
- Rapid development
- Emphasis of testing
- Close customer communication
- Flexible requirements

Criticisms

- Scalability
- Requirement drift
- Lack of high level oversight

> Principles behind Agile Manifesto focus on delivery of working software incrementally, self-organizing team adjust its behavior reflectively, fact to face communications, listen to voice from customers while change requirements accordingly event it is late in the development, and simple design. ( WORKING_SOFTWARE, TEAM, COMMUNICATION, CUSTOMER, CHANGE, DESIGN )

> Extreme Programming aim at minimize the cost of changes: Designing: Simplicity, Coding: Pair programming, Testing: Extensive, Listening: Communication

> Scrum: Sprint, backlog, and other practices

## Quality in software

### Definition

Difficult to define. High quality software can be described as

- Compiles with specification
- Does "clever things" quickly and easily
- Doesn't fail

However those definitions are vague and imprecise

### Good enough quality

Perfection is too expensive to achieve, so compromise is made to trade quality for cost and time

Notion of trading quality for cost and time is a widespread, recognized and good practice in most industries

### Quality assurance and Quality control

Quality assurance: *Planned and systematic* activities implemented in a quality system so that quality requirements for a product or service will be fulfilled

Quality control: Observation techniques and activities used to fulfill requirements for quality

### Practices

1. Introduction of inspector takes up responsibility for quality
2. Development of quality control ideas and techniques
3. Consideration of cost of scrap and reworking
4. Systematic approach to control quality

> In order to build good quality software, the definition of software quality should be established in the first place, which has not so far. It is common to trade quality for cost and time, and it is generally considered a good practice to do so. Since perfection is unachievable, it is more realistic to build a software with acceptable quality from some measurable metrics

> Quality assurance is planned and systematic activities conducted to ensure the quality of a product. Quality control is observation techniques and activities to fulfill requirements for quality.

## The capability maturity model

Good process produce good result ( or is it? )

A good software development process will create good software

### Evaluation of software development process

Capacity Maturity Model is a development model, it outlines a series of stages in the development of a software developer, the idea is an organization progresses through stages as it grows and matures

An organization start out building software informally, after it has some understanding of its process, measurement and control are introduced and applied with specific goal and focus on process improvement.

Maturity levels

1. Initial: Unpredictable process
2. Managed: Reactive
3. Defined: Proactive
4. Quantitatively managed: Controlled
5. Optimizing: Improvement

Immaturity model:

1. Negligent
2. Obstructive
3. Contemptuous
4. Undermining

More recently CMM has been enlarged, refined and redefined as CMMI ( 24 process areas, 4 groups, staged or continuous )

### Process improvement in general

It's a cycle: Measure -> Change -> Evaluate

- Decide what to improve
- Decide what to measure
- Change are constrained by requirements imposed by clients.

### Product quality

Depends on

- People quality
- Process quality
- Development technology
- Cost, time, schedule

Because software development is an activity generally associated with commercial activities where profit matters, so quality and other standards may have to be compromised to get a product delivered at an acceptable time / cost.

> Good process has a positive effect on product quality, however in software development it is again hard to define what is a good process. There are certain development models to measure certain process, CMM outlines 5 different stages in the development of software. CMMI is the successor of CMM, it defines 24 process areas and 4 groups, it can be represented as staged or continuous.

> Process improvement in general follows the path of Measure, Change, Evaluate. However, there are undetermined factors such as what to measure, what to change / improve, and changes are often constrained by customer requirements.

> Generally product quality can be affected by personale, process, development technology and cost / time constraints. Sometimes ( often ) quality is compromised to meet the business requirements in a software project.

## Quality planning and Quality assurance

### What is project quality management

Some definitions on the subject

1. The degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfill requirements ( ISO 9000-2000 )
2. Conformance to requirements - project's processes and product *meet written satisfaction*
3. Fitness for use - product can *be used as intended*

Process of project quality management

1. Quality planning - *identifying which quality standards are relevant* to the project and setting out to satisfy them
2. Quality assurance - *evaluating project performance* to ensure that the project will satisfy relevant quality standards
3. Quality control - *monitoring specific project results* to ensure they comply with relevant standards and improve overall quality

Some perspectives:

- Planning is about deciding what to do, which standards are relevant, setting out to satisfy them
- Assurance is about evidence, having decided the standards to comply with, track all activities to satisfy the quality standards.

Aspects affects quality

- Functionality
- System output
- Performance
- Reliability
- Maintainability

### Quality assurance

All activities related to satisfying the relevant quality standard of a project

Tools

- Design of experiments: Objective to find which variable affects quality most
- Benchmarking: *Compare* with other project or product
- Quality audit: Structured review of specific quality management activities

> Project quality management concerns how much a quality standard is met and how much the intended value of a project has been delivered. Major activities related to project quality management are quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control

> Quality planning is about decided which quality standards to follow, to what level a quality requirement need to be met

> Quality assurance is about the activities conducted to meet the requirement from the quality standard

> Quality control is about monitoring the activities and improve the quality continuously

## Quality control

Quality planning and quality assurance are mostly about process, while quality control is mostly about product

Quality control's goal is to improve quality by correcting the cause of errors, software quality control is a set of activities for ensuring quality in software products, outputs are

- Acceptance decisions - determine if the product is acceptable
- Rework - actions to rejected items to meet requirements, specifications or expectations
- Process adjustments - correct / prevent further quality problems

### Tools and techniques (7)

- Cause and effect diagram, "Fish bone diagram", "Ishikawa diagram", "Five why"
- Control chart - result of process over time
- Run chart
- Scatter diagram
- Histogram
- Pareto analysis
- Flow chart

### Test

- Unit test
- Integration test
- System test
- Acceptance test

### Improving software project quality

Concerns: Planning, Assurance, Control

Other issues: Strong leadership, Cost of quality, Organizational influence, Workplace factors, Expectations and cultural differences, Maturity model

> Quality control is set of activities undertaken to ensure the quality of the product, its goal is to improve quality by correcting cause of errors

> Outcomes of quality control are: acceptance decisions, rework and process adjustments.

> 7 tools are commonly used in quality control. Cause-effect diagram, Pareto chart, Run chart, Histogram, Scatter chart, Control chart, Flow chart

## ISO 9000 and TickIT

Importance of standards

- Avoid repetitions of past mistakes
- Framework for quality assurance process
- Provide continuity and compatibility

### ISO 9000

ISO ( International Standard Organization ) is an organization set up to write standards, it develops voluntary technical standards adding values to all types of business, it contributes the dissemination of good technology and business practices, it supports the development, manufacturing supplying more safer, efficient and cleaner products and services, it safe guards users and customers

ISO 9000 is the basis for establishing effective and efficient quality management system, it is a family of standards, it defines set of rules to be followed in order to meet the needs from the customers, it is generic, so may be applied in almost any situation.

- ISO 9000 - Quality management and quality assurance standards, guidelines for selection and use
- ISO 9001 - Quality systems, model for quality assurance in design / development, production, installation and servicing
- ISO 9002 - Quality systems, model for quality assurance in production and installation
- ISO 9003 - Quality systems, model for quality assurance in final inspection and testing
- ISO 9004 - Quality management and quality system elements, guidelines

Cost factors to register ISO 9000

- Most creditable implementation of ISO 9000 involves external certification
- Certification
- Locations
- Employees

### TickIT

TickIT is a certification program for software and computer industry specially.

TickIT is finished and it is replaced by TickITplus

> ISO is an international organization defines standards for quality that are generic, to help organizations adopting the standard build product and services with better satisfaction from customers

> Standards are important because it 1. avoids errors from past 2. set up a framework to quality assurance 3. provides continuity

> ISO 9000 is a family of quality standards that forms the basis of a effective and efficient quality management system

> ISO 9001 is the quality systems and models for quality assurance in design / development

> TickIt is a certification program for software and computer industry, it is advocated by UK and Swedish government, it is not relevant anymore and is replaced with TickITplus

## Mythical Man-month

The tar pit - Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later

Distinction between program and programming systems product

- One or a small team or programmers can create an important program which eclipses the best efforts of large teams
- But to be really useful, such programs need to be transformed into
- Programming product or Programming system

Products - Can be run, repaired, extended by anybody

Systems - Collections of programs which interact in a coordinated, disciplined, documented way

Transforming a program to product or system status will generally triple the cost / effort needed to generate the original program

```
[A Program] -- x3 --> [A programming system]
    |
    x3
    |
    v
[A programming product] [A programming system product]
```

### Man-month

The amount of work one person is expected to be able to do in one month

Problems:

- Some things cannot be divided amongst more people
- Even if the task can be divided, the relationship breaks at extremes - There are other constraints to the task

Reasons:

- Usage of the man-month assumes a simple trade is possible between time and men
- Task tend to be not easily dividable
- Some tasks take time at their nature
- Some tasks require specialized skills
- More people on a task means more management, communication, and co-ordination

In a scenario that a milestone is missed, providing more manpower will

- Slowdown the progress ( or even stop initially, to train the new staff, adjust the plan and process )
- Usually project never recovers from such change, adding more people to a late project often makes it later

> The tar pits refers to adding manpower to an already delayed project usually make it even later

> Man-month is a term used to refer the amount of work a man is able to do in a month

> Man-month will work if all tasks can be divided easily and the efficiency of different people working on the same task is same, which is not the case in reality

> In real world, almost all the tasks are not easily dividable, and some tasks require certain skills while some others just can't be finished in shorter time

> Adding more people to a late project increase the cost of training new stuff and communication, so it slows down the progress initially, and very often it never catches back

## Group formation

Get people to work together effectively, avoid remaining a collection of individuals

### Group development model: Tuckman's Stages Model

Team Lifecycle

```
Forming -> Storming -> Norming -> Performing
              |                       |
              + - - - - - - - - - - - +
```

- Forming - Getting started, sizing up other members of the group, finding out about each other
- Storming - Infighting, clashes between members
- Norming - Members want to work together, emergence of commitment to the group, work identified clearly, respect for contributions of others
- Performing - The operation of a nature team, effort concentrated on the task

Working framework helps the formation and development of the group

- Regular meetings
- Structure to meetings
- Agreed communications
- Procedures so you all know objectives and deadlines
- Set a level of acceptable behaviors

A team and its members are all different, nothing will work for all of them, one have to find his own way, and problems should be expected

> Software need to be build by teams, good developed team have higher productivity

> There are frameworks for group development, one of them is Tuckman's stages of group development, its four stages are Forming -> Storming -> Norming -> Performing

> Setting up practices and working framework ( regular meetings, meeting structure, communication mean, and procedures ) is useful to group development.

## Industrial relations

Wages, salaries, trade unions, conflict and strikes. Also day to day like for employers and employee, contract of employment, collective bargaining, in general, the relationship between the "employed" and "employing"

## Finding bugs

One characteristic of high quality software is the absence of bugs

### Validation and Verification

- Validation - Is it the right thing? Is it what the customer actually needed / wanted ?
- Verification - Have to be build it "right"? Does it satisfy the requirements in the specifications?

### Testing

Black box, white box, grey box; Unit, integration, regression, stress; Alpha, beta

All tests should be traceable to customer requirements, test should be planned well in advance

Automated testing tools permit developers to specify test which are then run by the tool automatically ( pros: quick and visibility, cons: limitation of the tool, flexibility )

Code coverage / Test coverage is a measure what proportion of code is being exercised by testing, generally expressed by a percentage, A high coverage figure does not necessarily imply sufficient testing

### Artificial bug insemination

A technique for estimating number of residual bugs in a system

- Without the knowledge of the developers, errors are deliberately introduced to a system in random locations
- At the end of a period of testing, manager checks to see which of these new bugs been discovered
- The proportion of these deliberately inserted bugs is an indication of the testing coverage achieved in the period

Problems

- Assumption bugs found are fixed
- Assumption bugs are evenly distributed
- Team motivation

> Absence of bugs is a mark of high quality Software

> Validation refers to "build the right thing", verification means "built right"

> Type of tests, white box, black box, grey box, unit, integration, verification, acceptance, regression, etc

> Automated testing help to find bugs more timely, it comes with pros and cons

> Good test coverage figure does not necessarily imply good quality software

> Artificial bugs insemination is a technique for estimating number of bugs in a system by deliberately introducing errors in to the system before testing.

## Tendering, Bidding, Costing and Budgeting, CoCoMo

### Tendering

The process of bidding for work, an auction

Bidding process for contracts is normally conventional, closed auction, where potential suppliers submit a bid / tender

Often budding / tendering is not done in isolation, factors outside the particular contract come into play, traditional objective of maximizing profit is not always followed

Low bids can be made due to

- Win a prestigious project
- Permit training for the workforce
- Keep the workforce busy
- Compensate for a lack of reputation in the field
- Depress the price and profit attainable by competitors

High bids can be made due to

- To show interest / activity in a market or type of activity
- When it is "politic" to bid
- You don't really want to work, or think it's risky but will do it if there is a big profit in it.
- For aspects of a collection of tenders which are not of interest but tendering for just one would not be acceptable

"Bad behavior" Some bidders will enter a price they know they can't honor, and plan to exploit the difficulty for the client to change contractors mid project to raise the price

It does not always happen that a seller take the best price given

### To work out a tender

- Decide what the work will cost, add your profit
- Estimate what others may bid, and what the client will pay, calculate the profit margin
- Actually the reality is most bids / tenders have some elements of both of these

Costing

- Estimating likely cost is predicting the future
- It's subject to unexpected variation
- Unlikely to be exact

Usually thought best to divide activity up into parts

Estimate for each, sum to get a total

### CoCoMo

Constructive cost model, a model for estimating effort, cost, and schedule for software projects

### Budgeting

To use budgetary control is to allocate resources to activities / tasks, then monitor consumption of the resources as the task progress, control is then applied according to wether the task is using too much resources

> Tendering is the process to bidding for a software project contract, many factors are taken into consideration during the bidding, there could be many reasons behind a high or low bid, and the seller might not take the best bid at the end.

> Costing is the amount of resources been spent in order to deliver the product, there are certain models to estimate the cost.

## Gantt chart

### Planning and control

Planning is about deciding what you are going to do, how to do, and when. Do planning well and the whole project will finish on time

Information should be collected about the tasks which make up the project, includes how long they will take, and dependencies between tasks

Actions to bring the project back on track, or get it under control

Gantt chart is a visual way to represent plans and timings for a project, information it carries

- Task name, duration
- Dependencies
- Milestones
- State of tasks

### Critical path analysis

Project -> divide into tasks -> estimate how long each will take -> Decide the interdependencies -> graph showing the progress of the project -> There will be one sequence of tasks which can not be shortened -> A.K.A. "Critical Path"

The critical path is the one which determines the project duration, or the path on which any delay will delay completion of the project

It is the longest of all the paths from start to finish

Knowing the critical path helps to plan and manage the project because

- Knowing which tasks have to be complete on time if the project is to complete on time
- Which tasks do not affect the final completion time if work does not start on them at earliest
- Which tasks one maybe leverage to get resources from

More metrics in CPA

1. Earliest start (completion) time
2. Latest start (completion) time

Why care? It enables one to calculate some other useful numbers, "float" time, amount of time tasks can be delayed

### Slack time

- Free float time - the maximum amount of time a task may be delayed without delaying other tasks ( Appears in the last task in a non-critical path )
- Total float time - The maximum amount of time a task can be delayed without delaying final delivery of the project ( Appears in tasks on non-critical paths )

Critical path need not to be unique

### PERT

Program Evaluation and Review Technique is a refinement of CPA, three values are estimated for each task instead of one

- The shortest duration
- The longest duration
- The most likely duration

> Gantt chart, visualize project planning, contains information about task name, duration, dependencies and states

> CPA, Critical Path Analysis is conducted to get knowledge of the minimum time a project can be finished
