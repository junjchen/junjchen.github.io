### What information system failure mean

An information system failure is one that either

1. not perform as expected
2. not operational on time
3. can not be used in the way it was intended

As many as 75% of large systems are considered to be operating failures because *they didn't bring about the intended benefits*. A proportion of these failures occur when the systems are *not used as intended* or *not used at all*.

### Why failures happen

Organizational reasons rather than technical

1. Not understand system development implies organizational change
2. Insufficient user involvement leads to unmet user needs
3. Poor match between development methodology and organizational culture

### Poor management factors

1. Insufficient motivation
2. Incorrect estimation
3. Inadequate control of time
4. Inadequate control of cost
5. Lack of understanding and time to learn
6. Other human factors

### What's different about software

1. New
2. Different
3. Virtual rather than physical, so constraints to the real world don't apply
4. There is no manufacturing side of it
5. Complexity

> Software system is considered failed in many ways, either it is not operating as designed, not operating on time, or not deliver intended values.

> Failure can happen due to technical as well as organizational reasons. Commonly due to mis alignment of development steps and organizational changes / culture, and insufficient user involvement.

> Some of the poor management factors includes incorrect estimation, poor control on time and cost, and lack of motivation.

> Software is different from traditional product because it is new, different, virtual, complex, and does not need manufacturing.  

### Software development models

#### Waterfall

Linear nature, assumes stability and certainty about requirement and environment

```
Requirement
-> Design
-> Implementation
-> Verification
-> Maintenance
```

#### V model

Variation of waterfall

```
Requirements analysis <-> Operational testing
    High level design <-> Integration testing
        Detailed spec <-> Unit testing
            Implementation
```

#### Build and fix

Idea of cycles in development, notion of retirement

```
Build 1st version
-> Modify until client satisfied
-> Maintenance phase
-> Retirement
```

#### Spiral model

Nonlinear development, spiral iterating through waterfall stages

#### Others

1. Incremental
2. Prototyping / Rapid prototyping
3. Formal methods
4. Agile process
5. RUP ( Rational Unified Process )

> Software development methodologies is a splitting of software development work into distinct phases containing activities with the intent of better planning and management

> There is no perfect methodology, all with their pros and cons, real developments rarely follow any of them exactly

### Agile methodology

#### Manifesto

1. *Individuals and interactions* over process and tools
2. *Woking software* over comprehensive documentation
3. *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation
4. *Responding to change* over following a plan

#### Principles

1. Continuous delivery of valuable software
2. Open to changes, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently
4. Business people ( customer representative ) and developer working together
5. Motivated Individuals
6. Encourage face to face communication
7. Working software as measure of progress
8. Sustainable development, stake holders of the project maintains a constant pace
9. Attention to technical excellence and good design
10. Simplicity, do not over engineer
11. Self-organizing team
12. Team adjust their behavior reflectively at regular intervals

#### Implementation of Agile

Scrum, XP, ...

#### eXtreme Programming

Goal is reduce the cost of changes in requirement by having multiple short development cycles

1. Coding ( pair programming, code review )
2. Testing ( unit test, acceptance test )
3. Listening ( communication, planning game )
4. Designing ( simplicity, reduce dependencies )

Criticisms

- Informal changes from onsite customer
- Scalability

#### Scrum

Key feature: Sprint, a short iteration of product development

Practices

- Planning meeting
- Daily scrum
- Retrospective

Tools

- Product backlog
- Spring backlog
- Burn down chart

Features

- Small team, small increments of development
- Rapid development
- Emphasis of testing
- Close customer communication
- Flexible requirements

Criticisms

- Scalability
- Requirement drift
- Lack of high level oversight

> Principles behind Agile Manifesto focus on delivery of working software incrementally, self-organizing team adjust its behavior reflectively, fact to face communications, listen to voice from customers while change requirements accordingly event it is late in the development, and simple design. ( WORKING_SOFTWARE, TEAM, COMMUNICATION, CUSTOMER, CHANGE, DESIGN )

> Extreme Programming aim at minimize the cost of changes: Designing: Simplicity, Coding: Pair programming, Testing: Extensive, Listening: Communication

> Scrum: Sprint, backlog, and other practices

### Quality in software

#### Definition

Difficult to define. High quality software can be described as

- Compiles with specification
- Does "clever things" quickly and easily
- Doesn't fail

However those definitions are vague and imprecise

#### Good enough quality

Perfection is too expensive to achieve, so compromise is made to trade quality for cost and time

Notion of trading quality for cost and time is a widespread, recognized and good practice in most industries

#### Quality assurance and Quality control

Quality assurance: *Planned and systematic* activities implemented in a quality system so that quality requirements for a product or service will be fulfilled

Quality control: Observation techniques and activities used to fulfill requirements for quality

#### Practices

1. Introduction of inspector takes up responsibility for quality
2. Development of quality control ideas and techniques
3. Consideration of cost of scrap and reworking
4. Systematic approach to control quality

> In order to build good quality software, the definition of software quality should be established in the first place, which has not so far. It is common to trade quality for cost and time, and it is generally considered a good practice to do so. Since perfection is unachievable, it is more realistic to build a software with acceptable quality from some measurable metrics

> Quality assurance is planned and systematic activities conducted to ensure the quality of a product. Quality control is observation techniques and activities to fulfill requirements for quality.

### The capability maturity model

Good process produce good result ( or is it? )

A good software development process will create good software

#### Evaluation of software development process

Capacity Maturity Model is a development model, it outlines a series of stages in the development of a software developer, the idea is an organization progresses through stages as it grows and matures

An organization start out building software informally, after it has some understanding of its process, measurement and control are introduced and applied with specific goal and focus on process improvement.

Maturity levels

1. Initial: Unpredictable process
2. Managed: Reactive
3. Defined: Proactive
4. Quantitatively managed: Controlled
5. Optimizing: Improvement

Immaturity model:

1. Negligent
2. Obstructive
3. Contemptuous
4. Undermining

More recently CMM has been enlarged, refined and redefined as CMMI ( 24 process areas, 4 groups, staged or continuous )

#### Process improvement in general

It's a cycle: Measure -> Change -> Evaluate

- Decide what to improve
- Decide what to measure
- Change are constrained by requirements imposed by clients.

#### Product quality

Depends on

- People quality
- Process quality
- Development technology
- Cost, time, schedule

Because software development is an activity generally associated with commercial activities where profit matters, so quality and other standards may have to be compromised to get a product delivered at an acceptable time / cost.

> Good process has a positive effect on product quality, however in software development it is again hard to define what is a good process. There are certain development models to measure certain process, CMM outlines 5 different stages in the development of software. CMMI is the successor of CMM, it defines 24 process areas and 4 groups, it can be represented as staged or continuous.

> Process improvement in general follows the path of Measure, Change, Evaluate. However, there are undetermined factors such as what to measure, what to change / improve, and changes are often constrained by customer requirements.

> Generally product quality can be affected by personale, process, development technology and cost / time constraints. Sometimes ( often ) quality is compromised to meet the business requirements in a software project.
